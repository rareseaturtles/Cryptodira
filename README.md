# Cryptodira 🐢

**Slow and steady wins the race.**

Cryptodira is a community-driven project inspired by hidden-necked turtles. We're exploring a charity-focused token on Solana, where transparent mechanics might support real impact over time.

**Critical Disclaimer:**  
This is exploratory only.  
- Token is live but low-cap with high risk/volatility.  
- No funds managed or solicited as charity yet.  
- No promises, guarantees, value, returns, or impact.  
- Nothing here is financial, legal, or investment advice.  
- Governance evolving slowly; consult professionals before any involvement.  

Building community thoughtfully. Join discussions on charity, Solana, or turtle themes.

## Mission & Ethos
- **Slow and Steady**: Natural growth, no hype, transparency first.  
- **Charity Exploration**: Signal support for causes like environmental or animal welfare.  
- **Solana Fit**: Low-cost, fast for potential on-chain transparency.  
- **Community Focus**: Consensus-driven with safeguards.

## Current Status
Simple static site sharing ideas.

- **Live Preview**: Enable GitHub Pages in settings for https://rareseaturtles.github.io/Cryptodira/.  
- Features: Turtle-themed landing with mission, disclaimers, token/fund info.

## Future Ideas (Exploratory)
- Token as signal (no returns).  
- Multisig treasury → DAO grants.  
- Verifiable donations via partners.  
- Timelocks, approvals for safety.  

Hypothetical; no implementation yet.
